Hey there 👋  

I’m **Kevin (Jinglue) Zhang**, a graduate student in **Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences (QMSS)** at Columbia University with a background in **Marketing (UIUC)**.

I love working at the intersection of **data, consumer behavior, and storytelling**:
I analyze how people think, what they buy, and why they make certain choices—and then turn those insights into
**clear strategies, visuals, and narratives** that teams can actually use.

I’ve worked on:

- 📊 **Market & brand research** – Huawei Europe satisfaction survey, Alibaba Cloud brand research  
- 💸 **Investment & due diligence** – IPO preparation, trust-financing risk evaluation  
- 🌱 **ESG & product innovation** – turning leather scraps into upcycled products in the “Re-Cycle & Re-Loved” plan  
- 📱 **Digital content & growth** – managing WeChat, RED, TikTok with 40%+ client conversion

You can find more of what I’ve done and what I’m learning in this repo and across my projects.
